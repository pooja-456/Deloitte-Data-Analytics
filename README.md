Deloitte Data Analytics – Virtual Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains the work completed for the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation on The Forage platform. The simulation involved practical business-oriented analysis tasks using real-world style data. Two tasks were completed: a telemetry downtime investigation and a pay equality classification exercise.

Task 1: Telemetry-Based Downtime Analysis
Daikibo, a manufacturing company, collected one month of machine telemetry data from its factories in Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin and Shenzhen. The purpose of this task was to determine which factory experienced the most machine downtime and which device types contributed to it. The dataset was analysed using Tableau, where calculated metrics were created and visualised through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard shows that the Osaka factory recorded the highest downtime, and the breakdown reveals which machines caused the issue. All supporting files and the screenshot of the dashboard are included in the Task-1 folder.

Task 2: Pay Equality Classification
The second task focused on identifying possible salary inequality across roles and factories. An Equality Score was provided for each job role, where values between -100 and +100 represent the level of pay fairness. An additional column was created in Excel to classify each role as Fair, Unfair or Highly Discriminative based on the score range. The resulting dataset highlights that certain leadership roles have significantly unfair or highly discriminative scores, especially in the Meiyo and Seiko factories, while several engineering and operational roles display fair or mildly unfair scores. The completed file is included in the Task-2 folder.

Purpose of This Repository
This repository contains my completed work from the Deloitte Data Analytics virtual simulation. It is intended to showcase my ability to analyse data, build dashboards and interpret results for business decision-making.
